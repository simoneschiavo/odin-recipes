    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicago-style deep dish pizza is a unique and delicious type of pizza that originated in Chicago. It is characterized by its deep, flaky crust, which is made with butter and cornmeal for a crunchy texture. The cheese goes directly on top of the crust, followed by a layer of ingredients such as sausage, vegetables, or pepperoni, and then a thick layer of tomato sauce. To make an authentic Chicago-style deep dish pizza, you will need to use a deep dish pizza pan and follow a specific method for preparing the dough and assembling the pizza.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 1/4 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of yellow cornmeal</li>
        <li>1 1/4 teaspoons of fine sea salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 1/4 teaspoons of active dry yeast — the size of a standard packet</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups of warm water</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons of unsalted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons of unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>About 3 tablespoons of olive oil for coating</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 of a red onion, minced</li>
        <li>4 cups of mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the dough</strong>: To make the dough, you will need all-purpose flour, cornmeal, yeast, sugar, salt, water, and butter. Mix the dry ingredients together, then add the water and melted butter and knead the dough until it is smooth and elastic. Allow the dough to rise for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, then punch it down and press it into a deep dish pizza pan.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the sauce</strong>: To make the sauce, sauté onions, garlic, and spices in olive oil and butter until the onions are soft. Add crushed tomatoes, sugar, and fresh basil and simmer the sauce for 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the pizza</strong>: To assemble the pizza, spread a thin layer of sauce on the bottom of the dough, then add a layer of cheese and your desired toppings. Spread the remaining sauce on top of the toppings and sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Bake the pizza</strong>: Bake the pizza in a preheated oven at 425°F for 25-30 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
