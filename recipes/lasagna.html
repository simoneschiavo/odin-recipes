    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, preheat your oven to 350°F. Cook the lasagna noodles in a large pot of salted water until al dente according to package directions. Drain, rinse under cold water, and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet or dutch oven, brown the beef, sausage, onion, and garlic over medium-high heat until no pink remains. Drain any fat. Stir in the pasta sauce, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, ½ teaspoon of salt, and ¼ teaspoon of black pepper. Simmer uncovered over medium heat for 5 minutes or until thickened.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, combine 1 ½ cups mozzarella, ¼ cup parmesan cheese, ricotta, parsley, egg, and ¼ teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Spread 1 cup of the meat sauce in a 9×13 pan or casserole dish. Top it with 3 lasagna noodles. Layer with ⅓ of the ricotta cheese mixture and 1 cup of meat sauce. Repeat twice more. Finish with 3 noodles topped with remaining sauce.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake for 45 minutes. Remove the foil and sprinkle with the remaining 2 ½ cups mozzarella cheese and ¼ cup parmesan cheese. Bake for an additional 15 minutes or until browned and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna rest for at least 15 minutes before cutting. Enjoy!</li>
