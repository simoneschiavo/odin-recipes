    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe uses all-purpose flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, milk, butter, vanilla extract, and an egg. The batter should be thick and creamy, and you should allow it to rest before cooking the pancakes. Cook the pancakes on a nonstick pan or griddle over low-medium heat, and flip them when the underside is golden and bubbles appear on the surface. Serve with your favorite toppings.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour (290 g 10 oz)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar or sweetener (60g 2 oz)</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups milk (440ml)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter (60g 2 oz)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>Make a well in the center and add the milk, melted butter, vanilla, and egg.</li>
        <li>Use a wire whisk to whisk the wet ingredients together first before slowly folding them into the dry ingredients. Mix until smooth (there may be a couple of lumps, but that's okay).</li>
        <li>Set the batter aside and allow it to rest while heating up your pan or griddle.</li>
        <li>Heat a nonstick pan or griddle over low-medium heat and wipe over with a little butter to lightly grease the pan.</li>
        <li>Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the pan and spread out gently into a round shape with the back of your ladle or measuring cup.</li>
        <li>When the underside is golden and bubbles begin to appear on the surface, flip with a spatula and cook until golden.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining batter.</li>
        <li>Serve with your favorite toppings, such as honey, maple syrup, fruit, ice cream, or frozen yoghurt.</li>
